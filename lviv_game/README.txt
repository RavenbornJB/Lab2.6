My game here.

It's about a student who needs to pass a test in a few days.
You need to survive, study, and do other things, in order to pass that test and win the game.
Unfortunately, you need to eat and sleep, and also manage money in order to survive long enough.

You can run the game by running the main.py module.

Currently the game is in its alpha state, so the numbers are all messed up.
You can change them in the balance.py file.
In future, the game will be tested are the numbers will get balanced.
Also, more functionality will probably be added.

My game here.

It's about a student who needs to pass a test in a few days.
You need to survive, study, and do other things, in order to pass that test and win the game.
Unfortunately, you need to eat and sleep, and also manage money in order to survive long enough.

You can run the game by running the main.py module.

Currently the game is in its alpha state, so the numbers are all messed up.
(!!!)You can change them in the balance.py file.
Now, not all numbers are there because I didn't have enough time to refactor the code this much.
Only the main ones are there.
In future, the game will be tested are the numbers will get balanced.

actions.py contains all of the hardcoded location-associated actions.
Since this product is not for others to modify, I allowed for such inconvenience.
There was no better way.

game.py is where my classes live, Player and Location.
I plan to add NPC and Item later, represented by "pass" classes.
